# Code of Conduct

This is an invitation-only webring run by Nell Iris, Ofelia Grand and A. L. Lester. We have a topic each month that all members blog about and then share. You don't need to join in every month, but if you miss a few months in a row without talking to us about it, you might be removed from the ring. 

The basic rule is to communicate :). Thank you!
