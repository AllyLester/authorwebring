# More About Us

This is an invitation-only webring run by Scandanavian/European authors Nell Iris, Ofelia Grand and A. L. Lester. Please contact any one of us for a chat if you'd like to know more about joining in.

We have a topic each month that all members blog about and then share. You don't need to join in every month, but if you miss a few months in a row without talking to us about it, you might be removed from the ring. 

The basic rule is to communicate :). Thank you!
