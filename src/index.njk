    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>  
       We're a group of authors of LGBTQIA+ romance who blog on the same topic once a month.<br />
       If you're an writer who'd like to join in, please email Ally at ally at allester.co.uk.
    </p>

    <h2>For Participants:</h2>
    <p>
        Copy this code snippet onto your blog sidebar or just link to this page in a text link. The code will render a banner that links to the other members. Each month we add the links to each other's posts into our own. There's a spreadsheet. Ally and Nell like spreadsheets. 
    </p>
